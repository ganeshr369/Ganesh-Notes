                        exchange the information between each other is called a computer network. <br>
                        If one computer can forcibly start, stop and control another one, the computers are not
                        autonomous.</div>
                    <h3>Advantages</h3>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ease of accessibility: </strong>Modern computer networks are simple to use thus

                                Authorization is done via user id and password. </li>
                            <li><strong>Great storage capacity: </strong>A central server can be used to store data for
                                all computers in the computer network. So, if in case one loses the data, others have
                                it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT): </strong>IoT devices rely on computer networks to

                    <h4> Signals</h4>
                    <div class="definition ni34">signal is an electromagnetic wave that carries information from one
                        place to another, using a specific propagation medium, such as air, vacuum, water, and solid.
                        signals are categorized into two types: <br>
                        <strong>Analog signal</strong> <br>
                        Continuous signal which changes with time is called analog signal. <br>

                        <strong>Digital signal</strong> <br>
                        Signal represented in the form of discrete/fixed set of values is known as digital signal. It is
                        transmitted in the form of bits. <br>
                        <strong>Data communication</strong> <br>
                        Data communication is the process of exchanging data between two or more devices (sender to
                        receiver) through a transmission medium.

                        manner to the transmitted data. This is done because during data transmission due to noise, the

                    <h3> Network as platform</h3>
                    <div class="definition att3">"Network as a platform" refers to the concept of viewing a computer
                        network not just as a means of connecting devices, but as a foundation upon which applications
                        and services can be delivered and accessed. In this model, the network provides a set of
                        capabilities and services that applications can leverage, such as data storage, processing, and
                        communication. <br>
                        This approach emphasizes the network's role in enabling and supporting various applications and
                        services, often through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and other tools
                        that allow developers to build on top of the network infrastructure. By treating the network as
                        a platform, organizations can create more flexible, scalable, and responsive systems that can
                        adapt to changing requirements and support a wide range of applications and services.</div>

                    <h3> Internet architecture</h3>
                    <div class="definition ezrt">Internet is a meta-network, which refers to a congregation of thousands
                        of distinct networks interacting with a common protocol. In simple terms, it is referred as an
                        internetwork that is connected using protocols. Protocol used is TCP/IP. This protocol connects
                        any two networks that differ in hardware, software and design.
                        TCP/IP provides end to end transmission, i.e., each and every node on one network has the
                        ability to communicate with any other node on the network.
                        Internet architecture consists of three layers -</div>
                    <div class="list n-list e4uq">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Application protocol layer</li>
                            <li>Transmission control protocol</li>
                            <li>Internet protocol</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition e4uq"> The IP layer ensures the data gets to the right place, the TCP layer
                        ensures the data is correct and in order, and the Application Protocol layer allows users to
                        access and use the internet in a meaningful way.</div>

                    <h3>Trends in networking</h3>
                    <div class="definition ulla">

                                augmented reality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT): </strong>The proliferation of IoT devices is driving

                    <h2>1.4. Data Transmission: Analog and digital transmission </h2>
                    <h3>Data transmission</h3>
                    <div class="definition he4z">Data transmission refers to the process of sending and receiving data
                        between two or more devices or systems. The underlying principle of data transmission involves
                        converting data into a suitable format for transmitting it over a specific medium.
                        Data transmission can be categorized into two main types: analog and digital.</div>
                    <h3>Analog Transmission</h3>
                    <div class="definition he4z">Analog transmission involves the continuous transmission of analog data
                        signals through analog channels, such as telephone lines, copper wires, radio waves, etc. This
                        method converts the information into analog signals. <br>
                        Analog transmission is simple and can transmit data over long distances but it is susceptible to
                        interference and distortion, resulting in a loss of quality and accuracy. </div>
                    <h3>Digital Transmission </h3>
                    <div class="definition he4z">Digital transmission involves the encoding of data in discrete, binary
                        form, represented by ones and zeros to transmit data. This process breaks down the data into
                        individual bits and transmits them sequentially over a communication channel. This method is
                        more accurate and reliable than analog transmission. Digital signals are less prone to
                        interference, ensuring data integrity during transmission. However, digital transmission
                        requires the conversion of analog signals into digital formats, which may require additional
                        equipment and processing. Digital transmission methods can further be divided into two
                        categories: Parallel and serial transmission. </div>

                    <h2>1.5. Transmission impairment</h2>
                    <div class="definition e45nq">Transmission impairment refers to any degradation or distortion of a
                        signal as it travels over a communication channel. This degradation can be caused by various
                        factors, including attenuation, noise, distortion, and interference.</div>
                    <div class="definition e45nq"> <strong> Attenuation: </strong> Attenuation is the loss of signal
                        strength as it travels through a medium, such as a cable or fiber optic. This can result in a
                        weaker signal at the receiver end, leading to errors or loss of data. </div>
                    <div class="definition e45nq"> <strong>Noise: </strong>Noise is any unwanted signal that interferes
                        with the transmission of the desired signal. It can be caused by electromagnetic interference
                        (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), or crosstalk from other nearby signals. </div>
                    <div class="definition e45nq"> <strong>Distortion: </strong> Distortion occurs when the shape of the
                        signal waveform is altered during transmission. This can be caused by factors such as
                        frequency-dependent attenuation, dispersion, or non-linearities in the transmission medium.
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition e45nq"> <strong>Interference: </strong> Interference occurs when external
                        signals disrupt the transmission of the desired signal. This can be intentional, such as in the
                        case of jamming, or unintentional, such as from nearby electronic devices.</div>
