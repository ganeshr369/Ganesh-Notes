                    <div class="definition">
                        The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects, or "smart objects", that are
                        embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to allow them to connect and exchange
                        data with other devices and systems over the internet. <br>
                        IoT devices can include phones, appliances, thermostats, lighting systems, security cameras,
                        vehicles.
                        Today, smart watches track exercise and steps, smart speakers add items to shopping lists and
                        switch lights on and off, and transponders allow cars to pass through tollbooths. <br>
                        The IoT simplifies and automates tasks that are complicated and sometimes beyond the scope of
                        human capabilities.
                        IoT devices can communicate with each other and with other internet-enabled devices, and can
                        sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment. IoT can enable
                        seamless communication between people, processes, and things, and can provide sensor information
                        and improve quality control. It can also lead to automation, which can improve the quality of
                        service, reduce waste and labor costs, and simplify decision-making. <br>
                        However, IoT also presents some challenges, such as data security and equipment safety.
                        Sensitive personal details of a user might be compromised when the devices are connected to the
                        internet, and equipment in the huge IoT network may also be at risk.

                    <h2>1.2. History of IoT</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Although examples of interconnected electronic devices exist as far back as the early 19th
                        century, with the invention of the telegraph and its ability to transmit information by coded
                        signal over distance, the origins of the IoT date to the late 1960s. It was then that a group of
                        prominent researchers began exploring ways to connect computers and systems. A prime example of
                        this work was ARPANET, the network created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of
                        the U.S. Defense Department; this network was a forerunner of today's Internet. In the late
                        1970s businesses, governments, and consumers began exploring ways to connect personal computers
                        (PCs) and other machines to one another. By the 1980s local area networks (LANs) provided an
                        effective and widely used way to communicate and share documents, data, and other information
                        across a group of PCs in real time. <br>
                        By the mid-1990s the Internet extended those capabilities globally, and researchers and
                        technologists began exploring ways that humans and machines could better connect. In 1997
                        British technologist Kevin Ashton, cofounder of the Auto-ID Center at MIT, began exploring a
                        technology framework, radio-frequency identification (RFID), that would allow physical devices
                        to connect via microchips and wireless signals, and it was in a speech in 1999 that Ashton
                        coined the phrase “the Internet of Things.” Within a few years' smartphones, cloud computing,
                        advancements in processing power, and improved software algorithms had created a framework for
                        collecting, storing, processing, and sharing data in a more robust way. At the same time,
                        sophisticated sensors appeared that could measure motion, temperature, moisture levels, wind
                        direction, sound, light, images, vibrations, and numerous other conditions—along with the
                        ability to pinpoint a person or a device through geolocation. These developments made possible
                        the ability to communicate with both digital devices and physical objects in real time. For
                        example, by adding a tracking chip, such as an Apple AirTag to an object such as a wallet or
                        suitcase, it is possible to view its location. The same chip built into a digital device can
                        track its whereabouts if lost or stolen. Then, with the widespread adoption of mobile devices
                        such as smartphones and tablets and the introduction of pervasive wireless connectivity, it was
                        possible to connect people and things in a near ubiquitous way. As a result, smart traffic
                        networks, connected storage tanks, and industrial robotics systems became the norm. <br>
                        The IoT continues to evolve. Today it supports an array of use cases, including artificial
                        intelligence used for ultrasophisticated simulations, sensing systems that detect pollutants in
                        water supplies, and systems that monitor farm animals and crops. For example, it is now possible
                        to track the location and health of animals and to apply remotely optimal levels of water,
                        fertilizer, and pesticides to crops. <br>
                        Highly connected systems allow shipping companies and airlines to factor in weather and
                        mechanical problems and then optimize fleets for maximum loads and efficiencies. The IoT
                        provides motorists with real-time maps and navigation suggestions that route and reroute them
                        based on current traffic patterns. These systems reduce congestion and pollution and save time
                        and money.

                    <h2>1.3. IoT Architecture</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        The architecture of IoT is divided into 4 different layers i.e. Sensing Layer, Network Layer,
                        Data processing Layer, and Application Layer.
                    </div>

                        <div class="img-name">Figure: 4 Stages of IoT Architecture </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">
                        <strong>Sensing Layer: </strong>The sensing layer is the first layer of the Internet of Things
                        architecture and is responsible for collecting data from different sources. This layer includes
                        sensors and actuators that are placed in the environment to gather information about
                        temperature, humidity, light, sound, and other physical parameters. Wired or wireless
                        communication protocols connect these devices to the network layer.
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition"><strong>Network Layer: </strong>The network layer of an IoT architecture is
                        responsible for providing communication and connectivity between devices in the IoT system. It
                        includes protocols and technologies that enable devices to connect and communicate with each
                        other and with the wider internet. Examples of network technologies that are commonly used in
                        IoT include WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and cellular networks such as 4G and 5G technology.
                        Additionally, the network layer may include gateways and routers that act as intermediaries
                        between devices and the wider internet, and may also include security features such as
                        encryption and authentication to protect against unauthorized access.</div>
                    <div class="definition"><strong>Data processing Layer: </strong>The data processing layer of IoT
                        architecture refers to the software and hardware components that are responsible for collecting,
                        analyzing, and interpreting data from IoT devices. This layer is responsible for receiving raw
                        data from the devices, processing it, and making it available for further analysis or action.
                        The data processing layer includes a variety of technologies and tools, such as data management
                        systems, analytics platforms, and machine learning algorithms. These tools are used to extract
                        meaningful insights from the data and make decisions based on that data. Example of a technology
                        used in the data processing layer is a data lake, which is a centralized repository for storing
                        raw data from IoT devices. </div>
                    <div class="definition"><strong>Application Layer: </strong>The application layer of IoT
                        architecture is the topmost layer that interacts directly with the end-user. It is responsible
                        for providing user-friendly interfaces and functionalities that enable users to access and
                        control IoT devices. This layer includes various software and applications such as mobile apps,
                        web portals, and other user interfaces that are designed to interact with the underlying IoT
                        infrastructure. The application layer also includes analytics and processing capabilities that
                        allow data to be analyzed and transformed into meaningful insights. This can include machine
                        learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other advanced analytics capabilities.</div>

                    <h2> 1.4. IoT Frameworks</h2>
                    <div class="definition">An IoT framework can be defined as a set of protocols, tools, and standards
                        that provide a specific structure for developing and deploying IoT applications and services.
                        <br>
                        The framework of IoT typically includes a combination of the following:
                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hardware</li>
                            <li>Software</li>
                            <li>Networking elements (IoT protocols)</li>
                            <li>Device management</li>
                            <li>Security</li>
                            <li>Data management</li>
                            <li>Application development</li>
                            <li>Cloud-based platform.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">
                        These components work together to enable the seamless integration of IoT devices (what is IoT)
                        and systems. For example, the device management is necessary for updating and monitoring the
                        performance of the device. Protocols allow the different connections between devices and the
                        internet. <br>
                        There needs to be a cloud platform where data will be processed and stored, this also connects
                        with an application or platform that is in charge of displaying the data and allows other
                        functions or services.
                    </div>
                    <h3> Types of IoT frameworks</h3>
                    <div class="definition">
                        There are IoT frameworks that are open source, and others that are proprietary. IoT framework
                        open source doesn't mean that it is free, many people get confused with this concept. We have
                        even talked about IoT open source devices. <br>
                        Open source frameworks are useful because they provide access to the code of the platform in
                        order to make any modifications as needed and build the IoT application with more freedom.
                        Finally, proprietary frameworks are IoT frameworks that don't grant access to the source code,
                        they have an already established platform from which IoT product design and development
                        consultants can start working. <br>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Proprietary IoT frameworks</h4>
                    <div class="definition">AWS IoT, Azure IoT, IBM Watson IoT, KAA IoT, and Google IoT Core.</div>
                    <div class="list w-list">
                        <ul>

                                contains the cloud side to accelerate the release time of the solution, but also offers
                                frameworks in the device side, like a flavor of FreeRTOS an Operative System. This OS is
                                widely used in microcontrollers and their flavor makes it very easy to connect to their
                                cloud.</li>
                            <li><strong>Azure IoT: </strong>The solution used by many corporations. It shares many of
                                the elements of AWS, and also competes having additional resources for the devices like
                                their Azure RTOS.</li>
                            <li><strong>IBM Watson IoT: </strong>The alternative from IBM, more friendly for teams
                                already used to their applications.</li>
                            <li><strong>KAA IoT: </strong>With an open source version that is now deprecated, KAA
                                evolved into an enterprise and paid solution for IoT devices, and free trials to test it
                                before purchasing.</li>

                        In short, IoT architecture defines the overall design and structure of an IoT system, while an
                        IoT framework provides the fundamentals for developing and deploying IoT applications and
                        services.
                        In other words, the IoT architecture is the blueprint for a whole IoT system, on the other hand,
                        the framework IoT is the set of tools that helps to build said system.</div>
                    <h2>1.5. Benefits of IoT</h2>
                    <div class="definition">The IoT makes things around us more capable and responsive by connecting the
                        physical and digital worlds. IoT offers several benefits in our daily lives. Following are some
                        of its benefits:</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong> Easy Access </strong> <br> We may simply get the necessary information right
                                away, in real time, from wherever you are. All you need is an internet connection and a
                                smart device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quick operation </strong> <br> We can finish many tasks very quickly because of
                                the inflow of data. For instance, IoT makes automation simple. Additionally, smart
                                businesses can automate routine tasks to free up workers' time and energy. </li>
                            <li><strong> Monitoring Data </strong> <br>When we discuss IoT advantages and disadvantages,
                                tracking is its major benefit. Keeping track of product expiration dates also increases
                                your safety. </li>
                            <li><strong>Following New Standards </strong> <br>IoT is an area that is constantly
                                evolving, although compared to other high-tech fields, its changes are rather small.
                                However, it may be difficult for you to stay up to date on everything if IoT doesn't
                                exist. </li>
                            <li><strong>Better Time Management </strong> <br>Overall, IoT is a smart time-saving
                                technique. This is another benefit of IoT on the list of advantages and disadvantages of
                                IoT. You can do almost everything from the palm of your hand, including checking the
                                most recent news during your daily commute. Thus, you ultimately get a lot more time for
                                yourself. </li>
                            <li><strong>Automation and Control </strong> <br>There is a huge deal of automation and
                                control in the operations in working environments. This is because physical things can
                                connect and are set digitally and centrally via wireless technology. Moreover, the
                                machines communicate with one another to produce work more quickly and on schedule.
                                Additionally, it all works without human intervention. </li>
                            <li><strong>Cost Saving </strong> <br>Saving money is another key benefit of IoT in the
                                debate on the advantages and disadvantages of IoT. The IoT is suitable for many people
                                as the cost of tagging and monitoring devices is less. IoT mostly assists in making
                                people's daily lives easier by enabling efficient device communication. Thus, it helps
                                people save money and energy. </li>

                    <h3>Disadvantages of IoT</h3>
                    <div class="list r-list">
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>Dependency on Technology </strong><br>The internet connection is the key
                                requirement for IoT. So, it is useless if the Internet is absent.
                                Therefore, our dependency on IoT usage in daily life is also growing. Even the most
                                irrelevant
                                information might irritate us if we can't immediately get what we want. Our ability to
                                focus is
                                significantly decreasing as a result of IoT. </li>
                            <li><strong>Loss of Data </strong><br>It is good to have access to data but it is a demerit
                                in the list of Internet of Things advantages
                                and disadvantages. Your personal information is, unfortunately, more widely known. Data
                                breaches can
                                be stressful. If a client's information goes missing, businesses worry about them and
                                risk losing
                                their clients' trust. </li>
                            <li><strong>Operation Complexity </strong><br>While IoT may appear to manage tasks easily,
                                many complex actions are going on in the background.
                                The remaining steps of the process will be wrong results if the program accidentally
                                performs an
                                improper computation. So, it also explains why an error in the IoT is difficult to
                                debug. </li>
                            <li><strong>Inter Compatibility </strong><br>Many times, equipment from different
                                manufacturers connects. But, the issue of tag and monitoring
                                compatibility gets deeper in such scenarios. The solution to this drawback is for the
                                manufacturers
                                to create a shared standard. But there is a chance that the technical issues could still
                                exist. So,
                                it is also a drawback in talks regarding the advantages and disadvantages of IoT. </li>
                            <li><strong>Less Employment of Low-Educated Workers </strong><br>The automation of daily
                                tasks may result in the loss of employment for non-educated workers. Thus,
                                it will result in society-wide unemployment. Any technology can cause this problem, but
                                one can
                                overcome it through education. So, as daily tasks become more automated, there will be
                                less need for
                                human labor. This will be tough for laborers and less-educated staff. </li>
                            <li><strong>More Control of Technology </strong><br>Technology will increasingly have an
                                impact on how we live our lives. The younger generation already
                                relies on technology to complete even the smallest tasks. So, we must decide how much of
                                our daily
                                lives we are ready to automate and reduce to technological control. </li>
                            <li><strong>Security </strong><br>A lot of information is available on the Internet as it
                                connects to all household appliances,
                                industrial equipment, and public sector services. Thus, hackers can attack this data to
                                get private
                                information and the results would be terrible. This is a leading drawback when you
                                search for the
                                advantages and disadvantages of IoT. Try to keep the drawbacks under control now that
                                you are more
                                aware of them. </li>
