                    <div class="definition">
                        An information system can be defined as a set of interrelated components that collect,
                        manipulate, store data, distribute information to support decision making and provide a feedback
                        mechanism to monitor performance. <br>
                        The components that must be combined together in order to produce an information system are:
                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>People: </strong>Peoples are the most essential part of the information system
                                because without them the system cannot be operated correctly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hardware: </strong>It is the part of a physical component of an information
                                system which we can touch. The information system hardware includes the computer,
                                processors, monitors, printer, keyboards, disk drives, iPads, flash drives, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Software: </strong>It is a set of instruction that tells the hardware what to
                                do. It can be used to organize, process and analyse data in the information system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data: </strong>Data is a collection of facts. Information systems work with
                                data. These data can be aggregated, indexed, and organized into tables and files
                                together to form a database. These databases can become a powerful tool for every
                                businesses information system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Network: </strong>It includes internet, intranet, extranet to provide successful
                                operations for all types of organizations and computer-based information system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Procedures: </strong>It specifies the policies that govern the operation of an
                                information system. It describes how specific method of data are processed and analysed
                                to get the answers for which the information system is designed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback: </strong>It is the component of an information system which defines
                                that an IS may be provided with feedback.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>1.2 Cyber Threats</h2>
                    <div class="definition">Cyber threats are security incidents or circumstances with the potential to
                        have
                        a negative outcome for your network or other data management systems. <br>
                        Examples of common types of security threats include phishing attacks that result in the
                        installation of malware that infects your data, failure of a staff member to follow data
                        protection
                        protocols that cause a data breach, or even a tornado that takes down your company’s data
                        headquarters, disrupting access. <br>
                        Vulnerabilities are the gaps or weaknesses in a system that make threats possible and tempt
                        threat
                        actors to exploit them.
                        Types of vulnerabilities in network security include but are not limited to SQL injections,
                        server
                        misconfigurations, cross-site scripting, and transmitting sensitive data in a non-encrypted
                        plain
                        text format.
                    </div>
                    <h2>Hacker Techniques</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A hacker is an individual who uses computer, networking or other skills to gain unauthorized
                        access to
                        overcome a technical problem.
                        However, the term hacker is commonly used for an individual who uses computer, networking or
                        other
                        skills to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks in order to commit cyber-crimes or
                        illegal or
                        unethical work. <br>
                        Some hacking techniques used by hackers for their purpose are:
                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong><br>The hacker makes a perfect copy of a popular website and
                                uses a URL that is closed enough to the
                                original to go unnoticed. He then sends a legitimate-looking email to the target
                                containing a link to
                                the phishing site. The target will unknowingly sign in to the fake websites giving the
                                hacker his login
                                credentials.
                                (Tricking users into revealing sensitive information, often through emails or messages
                                that look
                                legitimate.)</li>
                            <li><strong>SQL Injections:</strong><br>Most websites use an SQL database to store
                                information about their customers. An application
                                communicating with that database can be exploited with SQL-injections if it's poorly
                                coded. The attack
                                is executed on the website's user-input fields (search box, login box, etc) that accept
                                illegal input,
                                giving the hacker access to the database. (Inserting malicious code into a SQL statement
                                to gain
                                unauthorized access to data.)</li>
                            <li><strong>DoS/DDoS:</strong><br>In a Denial of Service attack, the hacker uses a Botnet
                                (network of hijacked computers) to flood a
                                specific server with massive amounts of traffic. The server is quickly overloaded, and
                                all websites
                                hosted on it will be offline.
                                (Overloading a system with traffic to make it unavailable to users.)</li>
                            <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong><br>Essentially, it's guessing password until the hacker
                                gets it right. If a user has a weak password, i.e.
                                “1234” or “password”, the hacker can try to guess it either by hand or using specialized
                                tools.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fake WAP:</strong><br>Free Wi-Fi is common in public spaces like airports and
                                coffee shops making it an ideal target for a
                                hacker to exploit. The hacker creates a fake wireless Access Point (WAP) mimicking the
                                name of the real
                                WIFI, so user connect to it. While the users is connected to the fake Wi-Fi the hacker
                                can read all
                                information going through it, login credentials, credit card, and personal messages.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Sniffing/Snooping:</strong><br>The hacker monitors traffic on unsecured networks
                                to find relevant information that can be used in a
                                future attack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bait & Switch:</strong><br>In this attack, the hacker buys advertising space on
                                popular websites, and the ads will redirect the
                                target to a page full of malware. The hacker's ads will look legitimate and very
                                appealing to the
                                target, but as soon as the target clicks them they will be infected. It's called Bait &
                                Switch since the
                                hacker's baiting with good ads and then switching the link to a bad page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cookie Theft:</strong><br> Most websites use cookies to store user data and make
                                them load faster, this can be passwords, browsing
                                history, etc. if the connections are not secured through SSL the hacker can steal this
                                data and use the
                                cookie to authenticate themselves as the target.</li>
                            <li><strong>Waterhole Attacks:</strong><br>The hacker studies the target's daily routines to
                                find out his favourite physical locations(cafe), these
                                are the waterholes. Once the hacker knows the waterholes and the timing of the target he
                                sets his trap
                                using a combination of waterholes and the timing of the target he sets his trap using a
                                combination of
                                techniques.</li>
                            <li><strong>UI Redress/Click-Jacking</strong><br>In essence, the hacker tricks the target to
                                click on a specific link by making it look like something
                                else. It's very common on movie streaming or torrent download pages, when the user
                                clicks on “Download”
                                or “Play”, it's an advertising link they are clicking. In other cases, it can be used to
                                trick the
                                target to transfer money to the hacker from their online bank.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>1.3 Cyber Crimes</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a
                        networked device. <br>
                        Mostly, Cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money or some
                        profit.
                        But some cybercrime such as downloading illegal music files, distributing viruses, hate crime,
                        identity
                        theft, etc may be non-monetary. <br>
                        Some examples of cybercrime are:

                            <li>Identity fraud (where personal information is stolen and used).</li>
                            <li>Theft of financial or card payment data.</li>
                            <li>Theft and sale of corporate data.</li>
                            <li>Cyberextortion (demanding money to prevent a threatened attack).</li>
                            <li>Ransomware attacks (a type of cyberextortion).</li>
                            <li>Crypto jacking (where hackers mine cryptocurrency using resources they do not own).</li>
                            <li>Cyberespionage (where hackers access government or company data).</li>

                    <h2>1.4 Cyber Security</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems,
                        networks, programs, devices and data from cyber-attacks.
                        It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorized exploitation of
                        systems, networks and technologies. <br>
                        Cybersecurity has three goals:
                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Protect the confidentiality of data. </strong><br>Confidentiality is about
                                preventing the disclosure of data to unauthorized parties.
                                It also means trying to keep the identity of authorized parties involved in sharing and
                                holding data
                                private and anonymous. It is achieved using data encryption, authentication, security
                                tokens, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preserve the integrity of data.</strong><br>Integrity refers to protecting
                                information from being modified by unauthorized parties. It is achieved using checksums,
                                file permission, data backup, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Promote the availability of data for authorized users.</strong><br>Availability
                                is making sure that authorized parties are able to access the information when needed.
                                Standard measures to guarantee availability are backing up data to external drives,
                                implementing
                                firewalls, having backup power supplies, data redundancy, etc.</li>

                        Cyber-attacks can be extremely expensive for businesses to endure.
                        In addition to financial damage suffered by the business, a data breach can also inflict untold
                        reputational damage.

                    <h2>Types of Cyber Security</h2>
                    <div class="definition">We can categorize cybersecurity in the following types:</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong> Network Security: </strong>It involves implementing the hardware and software
                                to secure a computer network from unauthorized access, intruders, attacks, disruption,
                                and misuse. This security helps an organization to protect its assets against external
                                and internal threats.</li>
                            <li><strong> Application Security: </strong>It involves protecting the software and devices
                                from unwanted threats. This protection can be done by constantly updating the apps to
                                ensure they are secure from attacks.
                                Successful security begins in the design stage, writing source code, validation, threat
                                modeling,
                                etc., before a program or device is deployed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Information or Data Security: </strong>It involves implementing a strong data
                                storage mechanism to maintain the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in
                                transit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identity management: </strong>It deals with the procedure for determining the
                                level of access that each individual has within an organization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Operational Security: </strong>It involves processing and making decisions on
                                handling and securing data assets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobile Security: </strong>It involves securing the organizational and personal
                                data stored on mobile devices such as cell phones, computers, tablets, and other similar
                                devices against various malicious threats. These threats are unauthorized access, device
                                loss or theft, malware, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cloud Security: </strong>It involves in protecting the information stored in the
                                digital environment or cloud architectures for the organization. It uses various cloud
                                service providers such as AWS, Azure, Google, etc., to ensure security against multiple
                                threats.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>1.5 Types of Attacks in Cyber (cyber-attacks)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">Cyberattack is an attempt to disable, expose, alter, destroy, steal or gain
                        unauthorized access to a computer system, infrastructure, network, or any other smart device.
                        It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as
                        information and identity theft. <br>
                        Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories:</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Web-based attacks</li>
                            <li>System-based attacks</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Web-based attacks</h3>
                    <div class="definition">
                        These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of the important
                        web-based attacks are as follows-
                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Injection attacks</strong> <br> It is the attack in which some data will be
                                injected
                                into a web application to manipulate the application and fetch the required information.
                                Example- SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>DNS Spoofing</strong> <br> DNS Spoofing is a type of computer security hacking.
                                Whereby a data is introduced into a DNS resolver's cache causing the name server to
                                return
                                an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to the attacker's computer or any other
                                computer.
                                The DNS spoofing attacks can go on for a long period of time without being detected and
                                can
                                cause serious security issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Session Hijacking</strong> <br>It is a security attack on a user session over a
                                protected network. Web applications create cookies to store the state and user sessions.
                                By
                                stealing the cookies, an attacker can have access to all of the user data. </li>
                            <li><strong>Phishing</strong> <br> Phishing is a type of attack which attempts to steal
                                sensitive information like user login credentials and credit card number. It occurs when
                                an
                                attacker is masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brute force</strong> <br>It is a type of attack which uses a trial and error
                                method.
                                This attack generates a large number of guesses and validates them to obtain actual data
                                like user password and personal identification number. This attack may be used by
                                criminals
                                to crack encrypted data, or by security analysts to test an organization's network
                                security.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Denial of Service</strong> <br>It is an attack which meant to make a server or
                                network resource unavailable to the users. It accomplishes this by flooding the target
                                with
                                traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash. It uses the single system and
                                single internet connection to attack a server. It can be classified into the following-
                                <br>
                                <strong>Volume-based attacks-</strong> Its goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the
                                attacked
                                site, and is measured in bit per second. <br>
                                <strong>Protocol attacks- </strong>It consumes actual server resources, and is measured
                                in a
                                packet.
                                Application layer attacks- Its goal is to crash the web server and is measured in
                                request
                                per second. <br>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Dictionary attacks</strong> <br>This type of attack stored the list of a
                                commonly
                                used password and validated them to get original
                                password. </li>
                            <li><strong>URL Interpretation</strong> <br>It is a type of attack where we can change the
                                certain parts of a URL, and one can make a web server to deliver web pages for which he
                                is
                                not authorized to browse. </li>
                            <li><strong>File Inclusion attacks</strong> <br> It is a type of attack that allows an
                                attacker
                                to access unauthorized or essential files which is available on the web server or to
                                execute
                                malicious files on the web server by making use of the
                                include functionality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Man in the middle attacks</strong> <br>It is a type of attack that allows an
                                attacker to intercepts the connection between client and server and acts as a bridge
                                between
                                them. Due to this, an attacker will be able to read, insert and modify the data in the
                                intercepted connection. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <h3>System-based attacks</h3>
                    <div class="definition">These are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a  computer network. Some of the important system-based attacks are as follows-</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ol>
                            <li> <strong> Virus</strong> <br>It is a type of malicious software program that spread
                                throughout the computer files without the knowledge of a user. It is a self-replicating
                                malicious computer program which is attached to another executable program that
                                replicates by inserting copies of itself into other computer programs when executed. It
                                can also execute instructions that cause harm to the system. </li>
                            <li> <strong>Worm</strong> <br>It is a type of malware whose primary function is to
                                replicate
                                itself to spread to uninfected computers and consume its resources. It works same as the
                                computer virus. Worms often originate from email attachments that appear to be from
                                trusted
                                senders. </li>
                            <li> <strong>Trojan horse</strong> <br>It is a malicious program that occurs unexpected
                                changes
                                to computer setting and unusual activity, even when the computer should be idle. It
                                misleads
                                the user of its true intent. It appears to be a normal but when opened/executed some
                                malicious code will run in the background. </li>
                            <li> <strong>Backdoors</strong> <br>It is a method that bypasses the normal authentication
                                process. A developer may create a backdoor so that an application or operating system
                                can be
                                accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. </li>
                            <li> <strong> Bots</strong> <br>A bot (short for "robot") is an automated process that
                                interacts
                                with other network services. Some bots program run automatically, while others only
                                execute
                                commands when they receive specific input. <br> Common examples of bots program are the
                                crawler, chatroom bots, and malicious bots. </li>
