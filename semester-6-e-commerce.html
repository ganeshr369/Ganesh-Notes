                        expanding as technology evolves and consumer behavior changes. Here are some key aspects of the
                        scope of e-commerce:</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Diverse Business Models: </strong>E-commerce encompasses a wide range of
                                business models, including online retail (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) transactions,
                                subscription-based services, digital products, and more. This diversity allows for
                                innovation and adaptation to various industries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Global Reach: </strong>E-commerce has a global reach, enabling businesses to

                                markets and revenue opportunities for businesses of all sizes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobile Commerce (M-commerce): </strong> With the widespread use of smartphones
                                and mobile apps, the scope of e-commerce extends to mobile commerce. Consumers can shop,
                                make payments, and access services through mobile devices, leading to increased
                                convenience and accessibility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-Border E-commerce: </strong>The growth of cross-border e-commerce allows
                                businesses to expand internationally without the need for physical presence in foreign
                                markets. This opens up opportunities for businesses to tap into emerging markets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Niche Markets: </strong>E-commerce allows businesses to target niche markets and
                                cater to specific customer segments. Niche e-commerce stores can thrive by offering
                                specialized products or services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital Products and Services: </strong>Beyond physical goods, e-commerce
                                includes digital products like e-books, software, online courses, streaming services,
                                and more. The scope of e-commerce encompasses the distribution of digital content and
                                services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Marketplaces and platforms: </strong>E-commerce marketplaces and platforms
                                (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Shopify, WooCommerce) provide businesses with tools to establish
                                and manage their online presence. These platforms offer a wide range of features and
                                integrations to support e-commerce operations.</li>

                    <div class="definition">The emergence of the internet is a complex and multifaceted historical
                        development that spans several decades. It has fundamentally transformed the way we communicate,
                        access information, conduct business, and interact with the world. Here is a brief overview of
                        the key milestones and events in the emergence of the internet:</div>
                    <h3>Emergence of Internet</h3>
                    <div class="list n-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Origins in ARPANET (1960s): </strong>The internet's origins can be traced back
                                to the 1960s when the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency
                                (ARPA, now DARPA) created ARPANET. ARPANET was designed as a decentralized network to
                                facilitate communication between research institutions and government agencies. It used
                                packet-switching technology, a precursor to modern internet protocols.</li>
                            <li><strong>Development of TCP/IP (1970s): </strong>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
                                and Internet Protocol (IP) were developed in the 1970s by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn.
                                TCP/IP became the foundation for how data packets are transmitted and routed across the
                                internet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Commercialization and the World Wide Web (1990s): </strong>The World Wide Web
                                (WWW) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, and it became publicly accessible in the
                                early 1990s. This marked the beginning of the internet's transition from a research tool
                                to a global communication and information-sharing platform. The introduction of web
                                browsers later like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator made the internet more user-friendly.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Dot-com Bubble (late 1990s): </strong>The late 1990s saw the rapid growth of
                                internet-based companies, leading to a speculative bubble known as the dot-com bubble.
                                Many internet startups went public, and investors poured money into these companies,
                                even if they were not profitable. The bubble burst in the early 2000s, leading to the
                                collapse of many internet companies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Broadband and High-Speed Internet (2000s): </strong>The widespread adoption of
                                broadband internet connections in the 2000s greatly improved the internet's speed and
                                accessibility. This allowed for the development of rich media content, online streaming,
                                and more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social Media and Web 2.0 (2000s): </strong>The 2000s saw the rise of social
                                media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which revolutionized how people
                                connect and share information online. This era is often referred to as Web 2.0,
                                emphasizing user-generated content and interactive web experiences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobile Internet (2000s-2010s): </strong>The proliferation of smartphones and
                                mobile devices led to the growth of mobile internet usage. People could access the
                                internet from anywhere, which further transformed how information and services were
                                consumed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cloud Computing (2000s-2010s): </strong>The development of cloud computing
                                technologies allowed for scalable and remote data storage, enabling businesses and
                                individuals to access and store data and applications online.</li>
                            <li><strong>IoT and the Future (2010s-Present): </strong>The Internet of Things (IoT)
                                emerged, connecting everyday objects and devices to the internet. This has the potential
                                to revolutionize various industries, including healthcare, transportation, and
                                manufacturing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rise of E-commerce and Online Services (2010s-Present): </strong>Online
                                shopping, streaming services, and remote work became integral parts of modern life,
                                driven by the internet's continued evolution and expansion.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">The internet's evolution continues, with ongoing developments in areas such
                        as artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and 5G connectivity shaping its future. The
                        internet has become an indispensable part of our lives, impacting nearly every aspect of society
                        and the global economy.</div>
                    <h3>Commercialization of Internet</h3>
                    <div class="definition">The commercialization of the internet refers to the transformation of the
                        internet from a government and academic research network into a platform for commerce, business,
                        and profit-making activities. This process began in the early 1990s and has had a profound
                        impact on the way businesses operate, how people consume products and services, and the global
                        economy as a whole. Here are some key aspects and milestones in the commercialization of the
                        internet:</div>
                    <div class="list n-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Emergence of the World Wide Web (Early 1990s): </strong>The World Wide Web,
                                created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, played a crucial role in the commercialization of
                                the internet. It provided a user-friendly interface for accessing and sharing
                                information online, making the internet more accessible to the general public.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web Browsers: </strong>The development and popularization of web browsers like
                                Mosaic and later Netscape Navigator in the mid-1990s made it easier for people to
                                navigate the web. This led to increased web traffic and the creation of online
                                businesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>E-commerce: </strong>In the mid-1990s, companies like Amazon and eBay emerged as
                                pioneers in online retail and auctions, respectively. They demonstrated the potential
                                for conducting commercial transactions on the internet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital Advertising: </strong>The commercial internet saw the rise of digital
                                advertising as a significant revenue stream. Banner ads, sponsored content, and
                                pay-per-click advertising became common ways for businesses to monetize their online
                                presence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Broadband Internet: </strong>The widespread adoption of broadband internet in
                                the early 2000s significantly improved internet speeds and enabled more sophisticated
                                online services and multimedia content. This further fueled the growth of e-commerce and
                                online entertainment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social Media: </strong>The rise of social media platforms like Facebook,
                                Twitter, and LinkedIn introduced new advertising and marketing opportunities. These
                                platforms allowed businesses to engage with customers and target specific demographics.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mobile Commerce (M-commerce): </strong>The proliferation of smartphones and
                                mobile devices in the late 2000s and 2010s led to the growth of mobile commerce.
                                Consumers could shop, pay bills, and access services directly from their mobile devices.

                    <h2>1.5 E-commerce Models</h2>
                    <h4>B2C — Business-to-Consumer</h4>
                    <div class="definition">Business-to-consumer is a business model in which businesses sell directly
                        to the consumers who purchase the goods for themselves. No third party, such as a wholesaler, is
                        involved. A B2C example might look like a clothing company that sells bathing suits to women.
                        <br>
                        The B2C buyer journey is short and simple. The consumer becomes aware of a need or want, they
                        consider their options, and they make a purchase. <br>
                        B2C business models may be the easiest to translate into the ecommerce space, and B2C businesses
                        have been many of the first types of businesses to do so. The buyer journey doesn't need to
                        change at all in a digital environment — the last two stages simply happen online rather than in
                        a physical store.</div>
                    <h4>B2B — Business-to-Business</h4>
                    <div class="definition">In a B2B model, businesses sell to other businesses — such as SaaS brands
                        that sell productivity software to other companies. The buyer is an employee (or an entire
                        department) purchasing a product or service on behalf of their company. Retailers, producers,
                        and agencies are all examples of B2B companies. <br>
                        B2B businesses aim to create relationships through a marketing and sales process that is more
                        complicated than most B2Cs'. The B2B sales funnel typically includes awareness, interest,
                        evaluation, engagement, and purchase stages.</div>

                    <h4>C2C — Consumer-to-Consumer</h4>
                    <div class="definition">C2C transactions don't involve a business at all. Instead, C2C business is
                        between two consumers, with a third-party company enabling the purchase. Consumers will publicly
                        share items for sale. Then other consumers can browse the listings or postings, decide what
                        they'd like to buy, and contact the seller. <br>
                        While newspaper classifieds could be considered C2C, today this business model is primarily
                        online. Examples of C2C ecommerce include:

                            <li>Exchange of services platforms such as dog walking app Rover</li>
                            <li>Exchange of goods platforms like Etsy</li>

                    <h2>Personal Web Server</h2>
                    <div class="definition">A personal web server (PWS) is system of hardware and software that is
                        designed to create and manage a web server on a desktop computer. It can be used to learn how to
                        set up and administer a website, and it can also serve as a site for testing dynamic web pages.
                        One of the main functions of PWS is to provide an environment where web programmers can test
                        their programs and web pages. Therefore, a PWS supports the more common server-side programming
                        approaches that can be used with production web servers. <br>
                        A personal web server, or personal server in short, allows users to store, selectively share, or
                        publish information on the web or on a home network. Unlike other types of web servers, a
                        personal web server is owned or controlled by an individual, and operated for the individual's
                        needs, instead of by a company. It can be implemented in different ways:</div>
                    <div class="list n-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>as a computer appliance</li>
                            <li>as a general-purpose server, such as a Linux server, which may be located at the owner's
                                home or in a data center</li>
                            <li>in a shared hosting model, where several users share one physical server by means of
                                virtualization, or virtual hosting.</li>
                            <li>as one feature of a computer that is otherwise also used for other purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Internet Information Server</h2>
                    <div class="definition">Internet Information Services (IIS) is a web server created by Microsoft for
                        use with the Windows NT family. In the context of ecommerce, IIS is not a direct component of
                        ecommerce operations, but rather a technology that can be used to host and manage ecommerce
                        websites. <br>IIS is a web server that can be used to host ecommerce websites, allowing
                        customers to access and interact with online stores. IIS is designed to work with Windows
                        operating systems, making it a suitable choice for ecommerce websites built on Microsoft
                        technologies such as ASP.NET or .NET Framework. IIS has a modular architecture, allowing
                        administrators to add or remove modules (extensions) as needed to support specific features or
                        protocols, such as SSL/TLS encryption or HTTP/2. IIS includes various security features, such as
                        firewalls and authentication mechanisms, to help protect ecommerce websites from unauthorized
                        access and malicious activities. IIS can be integrated with ecommerce platforms like Microsoft
                        Dynamics, SharePoint, or custom-built solutions, enabling seamless communication between the web
                        server and ecommerce applications..</div>

                    <div class="definition">ASP (Active Server Pages) is a technology used to create dynamic web pages. In the context of e-commerce, ASP pages can contain scripts that enable various features, such as:</div>

                    </div>
                    <div class="definition">These scripts can be written in languages like Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) or C#, and are executed on the server-side to generate the final HTML page that is sent to the user's browser. <br>
                    For example, an ASP page might contain a script that retrieves product information from a database, calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, or displays a personalized message to the user based on their login status.</div>

                                promotional material to consumers; it involves a publisher, and an advertiser. The
                                advertiser provides the ads, and the publisher integrates ads into online content. Often
                                there are creative agencies which create the ad and even help in the placement.
                                Different types of ads include banner ads, social media ads, search engine marketing,
                                retargeting, pop-up ads, and so on. </li>

                                various geographical locations and enable trading of items at negotiated prices,
                                implemented with e-commerce technologies. It enables more people to participate in
                                auctions. Another example of auction is bidding for seats on an airline website - window
                                seats, and those at the front with more leg room generally get sold at a premium,
                                depending on how much a flyer is willing to pay.
