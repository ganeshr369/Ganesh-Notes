                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Time-dependent: </strong>Continuous media, such as audio and video, are
                                inherently time-dependent. Their
                                processing is subject to time constraints, and their presentation is governed by start
                                and end
                                times, as well as duration.</li>

                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Real-Time Delivery:</strong><br> Continuous media data must be delivered in
                                real-time to avoid interruptions or delays
                                in playback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporal Dependency:</strong><br> Data within a continuous media stream is
                                temporally dependent, meaning that it must be
                                processed and played in a specific order to maintain coherence.</li>
                            <li><strong> Latency Sensitivity:</strong><br>Continuous media is sensitive to latency, the
                                delay between data transmission and
                                reception.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bandwidth Requirements:</strong><br>Continuous media streams often require
                                substantial bandwidth to transmit high-quality
                                audio and video.</li>

                    <h2> 2.3 Speech Generation</h2>
                    <div class="definition msiz">Speech generation, also known as text-to-speech (TTS), is a method used
                        in multimedia to convert written text into spoken words. This technology is used to create audio
                        output in various applications, such as virtual assistants, GPS systems, and audiobooks.
                        The process of speech generation involves several steps. First, the written text is analyzed by
                        a TTS system, which breaks it down into small units called phonemes. Phonemes are the smallest
                        units of sound that make up words in a language. <br>
                        Next, the TTS system applies rules of pronunciation and intonation to the phonemes based on the
                        language being spoken. This is called phonetic analysis. The system uses a database of
                        pre-recorded speech sounds to create a speech waveform for each phoneme, which is then combined
                        to create a full sentence. <br>
                        The final step is to convert the speech waveform into an audio file that can be played back by a
                        computer or other device. This can be done using various compression techniques to reduce the
                        file size while maintaining the quality of the sound.</div>

                <h1>Unit-4: Video and Animation</h1>
                <div class="unit unit-4">
                    <h3> What is Video?</h3>
                    <div class="definition ert23">Video is a medium that displays a sequence of images (frames) in rapid
                        succession to create the illusion of motion. It combines visual elements and often audio to
                        convey information, tell stories, or provide entertainment. Videos can be recorded using
                        cameras, generated through computer graphics, or a combination of both.</div>

                    <h3>What is Animation?</h3>
                    <div class="definition h4xq">Animation refers to the creation and display of a sequence of images or
                        frames that simulate movement. By presenting these frames in rapid succession, typically at a
                        frame rate of 24 frames per second or higher, animation creates the illusion of continuous
                        motion. Animation enhances multimedia by adding dynamic visual elements that can communicate
                        ideas, tell stories, and provide interactivity in a more engaging and expressive manner.</div>
                    <h3>Video Representation</h3>
                    <div class="definition">Video representation, as the name implies, specifies a way of representing a
                        video. While some work refers to video representation as the way to present or express video
                        content through some extracted or summarized content units such as scenes or objects, the
                        majority regard it more as the way the video content is stored.
                        In other words, it is about video format which describes the sequence, structure and content of
                        frames that create the moving video image, along with any possible audio or text (closed
                        caption) information.</div>
                    <h2>4.1 Video Signal Representation</h2>
                    <div class="definition h20rt">Video signal representation refers to the methods and formats used to
                        capture, encode, store, transmit, and display visual information as video.
                        It involves converting visual data into electrical or digital signals that can be processed by
                        electronic devices.
                        Understanding video signal representation is crucial for ensuring high-quality video production,
                        transmission, and playback.</div>

                    <h2> 4.3 Animation Language</h2>
                    <div class="definition"> Animation languages are specialized programming or scripting languages
                        designed to create, control, and manipulate animations. They provide a framework for defining
                        the behavior, timing, and interaction of animated elements in multimedia applications. Animation
                        languages enable animators and developers to describe complex animations in a structured and

                    <div class="definition">There are several methods of controlling animation. Here are some commonly
                        used methods:</div>
                    <div class="list n-list">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Frame-Based Animation: </strong>This method involves creating a series of
                                individual frames that, when played sequentially, create the illusion of motion. Each
                                frame represents a specific moment in the animation, and controlling the timing and
                                duration of each frame allows for animation control.</li>
                            <li><strong> Keyframe Animation: </strong>Keyframe animation involves specifying keyframes,
                                which are significant frames that define specific positions or states in the animation.
                                The software then automatically generates the in-between frames to create smooth
                                transitions between keyframes. By adjusting the timing and properties of keyframes, you
                                can control the animation's pace and appearance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Timeline Control: </strong>Animation software often provides a timeline
                                interface where you can manipulate the duration, order, and timing of various animation
                                elements. You can adjust the position of keyframes, add or remove frames, and control
                                the playback speed to achieve the desired animation control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scripting or Programming: </strong>Advanced animation techniques involve using
                                scripting or programming languages to control animations. By writing custom code, you
                                can precisely control the behavior of animated elements, create complex interactions,
                                and dynamically manipulate various parameters of the animation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpolation Methods: </strong>Interpolation methods determine how values
                                between keyframes are calculated to create smooth transitions. Different interpolation
                                methods, such as linear, ease-in, ease-out, or custom easing functions, can be used to
                                control the acceleration or deceleration of animated objects.</li>

                        development cycle that begins with product analysis, product development, and launch stages.
                        Although it has the same development roots as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), MDLC
                        has unique characteristics related to the development and use of multimedia elements. In
                        addition, although game applications are part of non-linear multimedia products, the complexity

                        multimedia products. On the other hand, Godfrey's version of MDLC puts too much emphasis on
                        non-linear multimedia products or games. <br>Based on the combination of advantages and
                        improvement of the weaknesses of various previous MDLC models, the author proposes an MDLC model
                        formulated into five stages, namely Initialization, Blueprint Design, Assets Preparation,
                        Product Development, and Testing & Validation. </div>

                    <h4>a. Initialization</h4>
                    <div class="definition">The initialization phase is the initial phase to determine the form of
                        multimedia
                        products to be developed. The output of this phase is an initial initialization draft document
                        that determines the requirements for the product to be developed, the structure of the team
                        involved, the duration of work, and the required development budget. <br>
                        Suppose the multimedia product to be developed is a linear product, such as graphic design or
                        animated films. In that case, this phase must determine the scope of the duration of the
                        animated film to be made, the perspective to be used in 2D/3D, the production pipeline to be
                        used, and the team's composition that will be used. Meanwhile, suppose the multimedia product to
                        be developed is a non-linear product, such as an interactive multimedia application. In that
                        case, this phase must determine what features to have, the platform to be targeted, and the
                        development technology to be used.</div>

                    <h4>b. Blueprint Design</h4>
                    <div class="definition ux98">The Blueprint Design phase is the most critical because this phase must
                        be able to produce various technical documents that will be a reference in the entire product
                        development process. Suppose the multimedia product to be developed is a linear product, such as
                        graphic design or animated films. In that case, this phase must produce initial sketches of
                        characters, environments, tone/shading, and central storytelling. In addition, this phase must
                        also produce detailed storyboards that will be used as a reference in the process of making
                        animation. If the multimedia product to be developed is a non-linear product, then this phase
                        must produce a user journey blueprint, user interface design, and
                        user experience. Before entering the production phase, this phase must also produce an initial
                        mockup of the application as initial validation.</div>

                    <h4>c. Assets Preparation</h4>
                    <div class="definition">The assets Preparation phase is a phase for preparing various forms of
                        multimedia assets used in the production process. The output of this phase is a shared library
                        that contains various forms of multimedia assets that have been classified and are independent
                        assets that are ready to be integrated with other assets. Suppose the multimedia product to be
                        developed is a linear product, such as graphic design or animated films. In that case, this
                        phase must produce character assets that can be animated have various expressions and
                        combinations of clothes/outfits if needed. This phase must also collect various generic assets
                        such as houses, roads, trees, and other secondary visual assets. In addition, this phase must
                        also prepare supporting assets such as audio, background music, and SFX. Suppose the multimedia
                        product to be developed is a non-linear product. In that case, this phase must prepare libraries
                        in the
                        form of UI/UX interaction elements and independent programming scripts that can be used in a
                        modular fashion to execute functions at each event.</div>

                    <h4>d. Product Development</h4>
                    <div class="definition ryut">The Product Development phase is the main phase in the entire MDLC
                        process.
                        The output of this phase is a multimedia product, either linear or non-linear. This phase is an
                        accumulation of various more minor production phases. In developing linear multimedia products
                        such as video and animation, this phase will produce several video clips, which will later be
                        integrated into the main file. While in non-linear multimedia products such as web or
                        applications, this phase will produce several UI pages or forms integrated into the main
                        application. </div>

                    <h4>e. Testing & Validation</h4>
                    <div class="definition">The Testing & Validation phase is a phase to test the resulting multimedia
                        product. Validation in this phase will be carried out using the initial document in the
                        Initialization phase. If there are still some features or functions that are not by the initial
                        design, then this phase will continue with production to improve the features or functions
                        needed. </div>

                    <h2> 5.7 User Interface Techniques</h2>
                    <div class="definition">User interfaces in multimedia systems should provide an intuitive and
                        interactive experience for users to engage with multiple forms of media effectively. In
                        multimedia systems, user interface techniques focus on making interaction with complex media
                        content as simple, intuitive, and engaging as possible. <br>
                        Some common techniques include:</div>
                    <div class="list w-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Direct Manipulation: </strong>Users interact directly with media elements
                                through actions such as dragging, clicking, or tapping. This offers an intuitive
                                experience. Example: Dragging a video timeline to jump to a specific part of the video.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Icons and Visual Metaphors: </strong>Icons and visual cues are used to represent
                                actions or media elements, making the system easier to navigate. Example: Play and pause
                                buttons for videos, or a speaker icon to represent audio.</li>
                            <li><strong>Menus and Toolbars: </strong>Drop-down menus, pop-ups, or toolbars offer quick
                                access to multimedia functions. Example: A toolbar that allows users to change audio
                                settings, toggle subtitles, or adjust video resolution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypermedia Navigation: </strong>Users can click on links within text, images, or
                                videos to navigate through different parts of the system or to external resources.
                                Example: Interactive e-learning apps where users can click on words to see definitions
                                or images.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multimodal Interfaces: </strong>Users can interact with the system through
                                multiple input methods, such as voice, gestures, or touch, along with traditional mouse
                                and keyboard input. Example: Voice commands to pause or play videos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback Mechanisms: </strong>Provide feedback through sound, animations, or
                                visual changes when a user interacts with the system. Example: Button clicks that change
                                color or make a sound to indicate the interaction was successful.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adaptive Interfaces: </strong>The interface can change based on user
                                preferences, context, or device being used, ensuring a consistent experience across
                                platforms. Example: Responsive design that adjusts layout and media display according to
                                screen size (desktop, mobile, tablet).</li>

                    <h4>What is data compression?</h4>
                    <div class="definition">Data compression is the process of reducing the size of digital data files
                        without altering their fundamental properties. It involves using algorithms to identify and
                        eliminate statistical redundancy, restructuring data, and applying encoding techniques to
                        minimize the number of bits required to represent the information.</div>

                    <h2>6.1 Need for Data Compression</h2>
                    <div class="definition"> Data compression is essential in various contexts due to the following
                        reasons:</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Storage Space Reduction: </strong>Compressed data occupies less physical space,
                                making it ideal for storing large amounts of data on devices with limited capacity, such
                                as hard drives, solid-state drives, and flash storage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Faster Data Transfer: </strong>Compressed data requires less bandwidth for
                                transmission, reducing the time needed to transfer files over networks and the internet.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Improved Network Efficiency: </strong>By reducing the amount of data
                                transmitted, compression helps alleviate network congestion and minimizes the risk of
                                packet loss and errors during transmission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost Savings: </strong>Compressed data requires less storage capacity and
                                bandwidth, leading to cost savings for organizations and individuals. </li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Performance: </strong>Compression can accelerate data processing and
                                retrieval, as compressed files can be quickly decompressed and accessed, improving
                                overall system performance.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Lossy Compression: </strong>Discards some of the original data to reduce the
                                file size, resulting in a trade-off between quality and compression ratio. Examples
                                include JPEG (image), MP3 (audio), and MPEG (video).</li>
                            <li><strong>Lossless Compression: </strong> Compresses data without discarding any
                                information, preserving the original quality. Examples include ZIP (general-purpose),
                                GIF (image), and FLAC (audio).</li>

                    <h2>6.3 Lossless Compression</h2>
                    <div class="definition">Lossless compression is a data compression technique that reduces the size
                        of a file without losing any information or data.
                        It achieves this by identifying and representing redundant data in a more efficient manner,
                        allowing the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.
                        Lossless compression is a reliable and accurate method for reducing file sizes, ensuring that
                        the original data remains unchanged. It is particularly useful in situations where data
                        integrity is paramount, and its applications can be found in various formats and technologies.

                    <h2>6.5 LZW Compression</h2>
                    <div class="definition"> LZW compression is a method to reduce the size of Tag Image File Format
                        (TIFF) or Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) files. It is a table-based lookup algorithm to
                        remove duplicate data and compress an original file into a smaller file. LZW compression is also
                        suitable for compressing text and PDF files. The algorithm is loosely based on the LZ78
                        algorithm that was developed by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv in 1978. <br>
                        Invented by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv and Terry Welch in 1984, the LZW compression algorithm is
                        a type of lossless compression. Lossless algorithms reduce bits in a file by removing
                        statistical redundancy without causing information loss. This makes LZW -- and other lossless
                        algorithms, like ZIP -- different from lossy compression algorithms that reduce file size by
                        removing less important or unnecessary information and cause information loss. <br>
                        The LZW algorithm is commonly used to compress GIF and TIFF image files and occasionally for PDF
                        and TXT files. It is part of the Unix operating system's file compression utility. The method is
                        simple to implement, versatile and capable of high throughput in hardware implementations.
                        Consequently, LZW is often used for general-purpose data compression in many PC utilities.</div>

                    <h3>How LZW compression works?</h3>
                    <div class="definition">The LZW compression algorithm reads a sequence of symbols, groups those
                        symbols into strings and then converts each string into codes. It takes each input sequence of
                        bits of a given length -- say, 12 bits -- and creates an entry in a table for that particular
                        bit pattern, consisting of the pattern itself and a shorter code. The table is also called a
                        dictionary or codebook. It stores character sequences chosen dynamically from the input text and
                        maintains correspondence between the longest encountered words and a list of code values. <br>
                        As the input is read, any repetitive results are substituted with the shorter code, effectively
                        compressing the total amount of input. The shorter code takes up less space than the string it
                        replaces, resulting in a smaller file. As the number of long, repetitive words increases in the
                        input data, the algorithm's efficiency also increases. Compression occurs when the output is a
                        single code instead of a longer string of characters. This code can be of any length and always
                        has more bits than a single character. <br>
                        The LZW algorithm does not analyze the incoming text. It simply adds every new string of
                        characters it sees into a code table. Since it tries to recognize increasingly longer and
                        repetitive phrases and encode them, LZW is referred to as a greedy algorithm.</div>

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Object </strong><br>It is an instance of the class. All objects, derived from

                                includes a set of operations, which are called methods. Object communicates among each
