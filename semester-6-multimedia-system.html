                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Time-dependent: </strong>Continuous media, such as audio and video, are
                                inherently time-dependent. Their
                                processing is subject to time constraints, and their presentation is governed by start
                                and end
                                times, as well as duration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unconnected vs. Connected: </strong>A data stream with gaps between information
                                units is called an
                                unconnected data stream. In contrast, a connected data stream has no gaps between

                                or information units.</li>
                            <li><strong>Packetization: </strong>Data streams are often packetized, where each packet
                                contains a fixed amount of
                                data, such as a video frame or an audio sample. This allows for efficient transmission

                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Real-Time Delivery:</strong><br> Continuous media data must be delivered in
                                real-time to avoid interruptions or delays
                                in playback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporal Dependency:</strong><br> Data within a continuous media stream is
                                temporally dependent, meaning that it must be
                                processed and played in a specific order to maintain coherence.</li>
                            <li><strong> Latency Sensitivity:</strong><br>Continuous media is sensitive to latency, the
                                delay between data transmission and
                                reception.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bandwidth Requirements:</strong><br>Continuous media streams often require
                                substantial bandwidth to transmit high-quality
                                audio and video.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buffering:</strong><br>To manage variability in network conditions and ensure

                                media streams use buffering to temporarily store data before playback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Error Resilience:</strong><br>Continuous media streams must handle errors and
                                data loss gracefully, often using error
                                correction and concealment techniques.</li>

                            <li><strong>Packetization:</strong><br>Information units are often broken down into packets
                                or chunks for transmission over
                                networks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Latency Tolerance:</strong><br>Unlike continuous media, information units may
                                tolerate higher latency as they are
                                processed in discrete chunks rather than in real-time.</li>
                            <li><strong> Compression and Encoding:</strong><br>Information units often use compression
                                and encoding techniques to reduce file size and
                                optimize transmission.</li>

                    <h2> 2.3 Speech Generation</h2>
                    <div class="definition msiz">Speech generation, also known as text-to-speech (TTS), is a method used
                        in multimedia to convert written text into spoken words. This technology is used to create audio
                        output in various applications, such as virtual assistants, GPS systems, and audiobooks.
                        The process of speech generation involves several steps. First, the written text is analyzed by
                        a TTS system, which breaks it down into small units called phonemes. Phonemes are the smallest
                        units of sound that make up words in a language. <br>
                        Next, the TTS system applies rules of pronunciation and intonation to the phonemes based on the
                        language being spoken. This is called phonetic analysis. The system uses a database of
                        pre-recorded speech sounds to create a speech waveform for each phoneme, which is then combined
                        to create a full sentence. <br>
                        The final step is to convert the speech waveform into an audio file that can be played back by a
                        computer or other device. This can be done using various compression techniques to reduce the
                        file size while maintaining the quality of the sound.</div>

                <div class="unit unit-4">
                    <h3> What is Video?</h3>
                    <div class="definition ert23">Video is a medium that displays a sequence of images (frames) in rapid
                        succession to create the illusion of motion. It combines visual elements and often audio to
                        convey information, tell stories, or provide entertainment. Videos can be recorded using
                        cameras, generated through computer graphics, or a combination of both.</div>

                    <h3>What is Animation?</h3>
                    <div class="definition h4xq">Animation refers to the creation and display of a sequence of images or
                        frames that simulate movement. By presenting these frames in rapid succession, typically at a
                        frame rate of 24 frames per second or higher, animation creates the illusion of continuous
                        motion. Animation enhances multimedia by adding dynamic visual elements that can communicate
                        ideas, tell stories, and provide interactivity in a more engaging and expressive manner.</div>
                    <h3>Video Representation</h3>
                    <div class="definition">Video representation, as the name implies, specifies a way of representing a
                        video. While some work refers to video representation as the way to present or express video
                        content through some extracted or summarized content units such as scenes or objects, the
                        majority regard it more as the way the video content is stored.
                        In other words, it is about video format which describes the sequence, structure and content of
                        frames that create the moving video image, along with any possible audio or text (closed
                        caption) information.</div>
                    <h2>4.1 Video Signal Representation</h2>
                    <div class="definition h20rt">Video signal representation refers to the methods and formats used to
                        capture, encode, store, transmit, and display visual information as video.
                        It involves converting visual data into electrical or digital signals that can be processed by
                        electronic devices.
                        Understanding video signal representation is crucial for ensuring high-quality video production,
                        transmission, and playback.</div>

                    <h2> 4.3 Animation Language</h2>
                    <div class="definition"> Animation languages are specialized programming or scripting languages
                        designed to create, control, and manipulate animations. They provide a framework for defining
                        the behavior, timing, and interaction of animated elements in multimedia applications. Animation
                        languages enable animators and developers to describe complex animations in a structured and

                    <h2> 4.4 Methods of Controlling Animation (8 Marks)</h2>
                    <div class="definition">There are several methods of controlling animation. Here are some commonly
                        used methods:</div>
                    <div class="list n-list">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Frame-Based Animation: </strong>This method involves creating a series of
                                individual frames that, when played sequentially, create the illusion of motion. Each
                                frame represents a specific moment in the animation, and controlling the timing and
                                duration of each frame allows for animation control.</li>
                            <li><strong> Keyframe Animation: </strong>Keyframe animation involves specifying keyframes,
                                which are significant frames that define specific positions or states in the animation.
                                The software then automatically generates the in-between frames to create smooth
                                transitions between keyframes. By adjusting the timing and properties of keyframes, you
                                can control the animation's pace and appearance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Timeline Control: </strong>Animation software often provides a timeline
                                interface where you can manipulate the duration, order, and timing of various animation
                                elements. You can adjust the position of keyframes, add or remove frames, and control
                                the playback speed to achieve the desired animation control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scripting or Programming: </strong>Advanced animation techniques involve using
                                scripting or programming languages to control animations. By writing custom code, you
                                can precisely control the behavior of animated elements, create complex interactions,
                                and dynamically manipulate various parameters of the animation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpolation Methods: </strong>Interpolation methods determine how values
                                between keyframes are calculated to create smooth transitions. Different interpolation
                                methods, such as linear, ease-in, ease-out, or custom easing functions, can be used to
                                control the acceleration or deceleration of animated objects.</li>
                        </ol>
