                    <div class="list">

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong> Combination of Media: </strong>A multimedia system combines multiple media
                                types, such as text, images,
                                audio, and video, to create a unified presentation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Independence: </strong> Each media type is independent of the others, allowing
                                for flexible manipulation and
                                presentation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Computer-Supported Integration: </strong>The system is controlled by a computer,
                                which enables efficient
                                integration and management of the various media components.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication System: </strong>The multimedia system includes a communication
                                component, enabling the
                                exchange of information between devices and users.</li>

                    <h2>1.8 Data stream characteristics</h2>
                    <div class="definition">
                        A data stream in multimedia refers to a continuous flow of data that carries various forms of media
                    content, such as audio, video, text, and images, from a source to a destination. This data can be
                    transmitted in real-time or stored for later use.
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Data Stream Characteristics</h3>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Time-dependent: </strong>Continuous media, such as audio and video, are inherently time-dependent. Their
                    processing is subject to time constraints, and their presentation is governed by start and end
                    times, as well as duration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unconnected vs. Connected: </strong>A data stream with gaps between information units is called an
                    unconnected data stream. In contrast, a connected data stream has no gaps between individual packets
                    or information units.</li>
                            <li><strong>Packetization: </strong>Data streams are often packetized, where each packet contains a fixed amount of
                    data, such as a video frame or an audio sample. This allows for efficient transmission and
                    processing of the data stream.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variable Bit Rate (VBR) vs. Constant Bit Rate (CBR): </strong>Data streams can have variable or constant
                    bit rates, depending on the compression algorithm and the type of media being transmitted. VBR
                    streams adapt to changing data rates, while CBR streams maintain a consistent rate.</li>

                    <h2>1.9 Data Stream Characteristics for Continuous Media</h2>    
                    <div class="definition">
                        Continuous media refers to types of multimedia data that are streamed or played in a continuous
                    flow, such as audio and video. <br> Here are the key characteristics:
                    </div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Real-Time Delivery:</strong><br> Continuous media data must be delivered in real-time to avoid interruptions or delays
                    in playback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporal Dependency:</strong><br> Data within a continuous media stream is temporally dependent, meaning that it must be
                    processed and played in a specific order to maintain coherence.</li>
                            <li><strong> Latency Sensitivity:</strong><br>Continuous media is sensitive to latency, the delay between data transmission and
                    reception.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bandwidth Requirements:</strong><br>Continuous media streams often require substantial bandwidth to transmit high-quality
                    audio and video.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buffering:</strong><br>To manage variability in network conditions and ensure smooth playback, continuous
                    media streams use buffering to temporarily store data before playback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Error Resilience:</strong><br>Continuous media streams must handle errors and data loss gracefully, often using error
                    correction and concealment techniques.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Data Stream Characteristics for Information Units</h3>
                    <div class="definition">Information units refer to discrete chunks of data that can be individually processed or accessed,
                    such as files or packets of data in a multimedia system. <br>
                    The characteristics of data streams for information units are:</div>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Discrete and Structured:</strong><br>Information units are discrete and often organized in a structured format, such as
                    files or packets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Packetization:</strong><br>Information units are often broken down into packets or chunks for transmission over
                    networks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Latency Tolerance:</strong><br>Unlike continuous media, information units may tolerate higher latency as they are
                    processed in discrete chunks rather than in real-time.</li>
                            <li><strong> Compression and Encoding:</strong><br>Information units often use compression and encoding techniques to reduce file size and
                    optimize transmission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Error Detection and Correction:</strong><br>Error detection and correction mechanisms are applied to information units to ensure
                    data integrity during transmission and storage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong><br>Information units can be scaled and managed in terms of size and quantity, allowing for
                    handling large datasets or multiple files.</li>
                        </ul>
